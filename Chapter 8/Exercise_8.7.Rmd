Exercise 8.7
------------

Setting up:

```{r}
library(randomForest)
set.seed(1)
library(MASS)
attach(Boston)
train = sample(1:nrow(Boston), nrow(Boston)/2)
```

Calculating test error as a function of mtry and ntree:

```{r}
testerror = matrix(rep(0, len=55), nrow=11)
for(mtry in seq(4, 12, 2)) {
  for(ntree in seq(1, 101, 10)) {
    RF = randomForest(medv~., data=Boston, subset = train, mtry=mtry, ntree=ntree)
    pred = predict(RF, newdata = Boston[-train,])
    testerror[(ntree-1)/10+1, mtry/2-1] = mean((pred - Boston[-train, "medv"])^2)
  }
}

```

The following plot shows that test error decreases with number of trees, and somewhat by going to smaller mtry. However, errors on the curves seem to be large.

```{r}
matplot(testerror, type="l", col=c(1,2,3,4,5), xaxt="n", xlab = "ntree")
axis(1, at = 1:11, labels = seq(1,101,10))
legend("topright", c("mtry = 4", "mtry = 6", "mtry = 8", "mtry = 10", "mtry = 12"), col=c(1,2,3,4,5), lwd=1)
```
