Exercise 10.9
-------------

Hierarchical clustering on the raw data:

```{r}
attach(USArrests)
clust = hclust(dist(USArrests))
plot(clust)
```

And on the scaled data:

```{r}
scaledclust = hclust(dist(scale(USArrests)))
plot(scaledclust)
```

The results are quite different:

```{r}
pred = cutree(clust, 3)
scaledpred = cutree(scaledclust, 3)
table(pred, scaledpred)
```

It is better to scale the variables. The Euclidean distance metric depends on the units and will also be sensitive to differences in variance.
